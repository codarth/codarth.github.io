            <p>To get started you need an account with the <a href="geocaching.com">Geocaching</a> web site. You will need a GPS device, your smart phone will work. If you are using your phone you will need a geocaching app. There is the official app or there are others that work with your account too. If you are using a handheld GPS you will need to use the Geocaching site to get the locations of the caches.</p>
            <p>Now that you have the app or the location of a cache on you GPS, you are ready to go. With the app you can see where the caches are around you. And you're ready to go!</p>

                    <h4>CARL : Cache And Relax</h4>
                    <p>Locals gather after a week of hiding caches just for the event. On Friday evening the hunt starts. For the next 24 hours people find the caches for the event. On Saturday evening they gather to tell stories and perhaps have a potluck. Ther may be prizes aswell.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>CITO : Cache In Trash Out</h4>
                    <p>This is a way to help keep the world clean. As you are out caching, if you find garbage, take it out with you and throw it in the trash. Large event gatherings are held just to do this.</p>
