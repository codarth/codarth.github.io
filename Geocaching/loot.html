            <h1 class="title">Caches</h1>
            <h2>Log Book</h2>
            <p>A log book is a must. This can be a small rolled up peice of paper in a micro cache. Or a full size not book in a large cache. The exception is the earth caches since there is no physical cache to find.</p>
            <h2>Trackables</h2>
            <p>These are items with a special number on them that you can go online and track. you can see where it has been and what (if any) goals it has.</p>
            <p>These are usually a dog tag that are attached to a item, like a toy car. Also, they are very common as coins. again with a tracking number on them.</p>
            <p>If you find one you take it and put it in another cache along your adventure. Try not to hold on to it for long. If you do not want to take it simply note the tracking number and you can still log you seen it.</p>
            <h2>Miscellanious items</h2>
            <p>The items you will find in a cache will be worthless (for the most part). They will be trinkets, toys (eg. kinder surprise toy), erasers, what ever really, with in reason.</p>
            <p>Some cachers when hiding a cache add a prise as a 'first to find' reward. This can be a gift card to a local shop, a fish hook to use at the lake near by, or anything really. Again within reason</p>
            <h2>Not good items</h2>
            <p>Things not to put in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Food</h4>
                    <p>Food attracts animals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Promotional items</h4>
                    <p>Do not use caches to advertise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Religious Items</h4>
                    <p>These items may not be well received.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use your good judgement on what you put in.</p>
