            <h1 class="title">What Can You Do With A Cache?</h1>
            <p>Geocaches are typically a container of varying size hidden by someone who posted its coordinates online. Though this does not have to be.</p>

            <h2>Types of caches</h2>
            <p>There are a wide variety of cache types. Here are just a few of the more common ones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Traditional</h4>
                    <p>It consists of a container with a logbook , and is located at the posted coordinates</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Multi-Cache</h4>
                    <p>Includes at least one stage in addition to the physical final container with a logbook. The posted coordinates for a Multi-Cache are the first stage. At each stage, the geocacher gathers information that leads them to the next stage or to the final container.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Mystery</h4>
                    <p>Mystery Caches can have many different designs. Here are the most common ones.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Puzzle caches</h4>
                            The posted coordinates are usually bogus coordinates. Geocachers must solve a puzzle on the cache page to get the coordinates for the first stage or the final container. All clues needed to solve the puzzle must be on the cache page, and the information to solve the puzzle must be publicly available. Before you submit the cache page, post a Reviewer Note with an explanation of how the puzzle is solved. Reviewer Notes are automatically deleted when the cache is published.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Bonus caches</h4>
                            Clues for bonus caches are often hidden in one or more other caches by the same cache owner. Generally, bonus cache clues should not be placed in another bonus geocache.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Challenge caches</h4>
                            Challenge caches encourage geocachers to set and achieve fun goals. The seeker has to find a set of geocaches defined by the challenge owner before they can log their find. The container must be placed at the posted coordinates, either as posted coordinates or as a visible additional waypoint.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Beacon caches</h4>
                            Beacon caches include a wireless transmission device at one of their stages.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Night caches</h4>
                            Geocachers use a flashlight or UV light to follow a series of reflectors to the final location.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Sizes of caches</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Micro (XS)</h4>
                    Micro containers are less than 100 milliliters. They’re about the size of a film canister, or smaller. They can hold a tiny logbook or log sheet. If a micro cache is less than 10 milliliters, it’s often called a nano cache.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Small (S)</h4>
                    Small containers are 100 milliliters to 1 liter. They’re about the size of an apple. They can hold a small logbook and trade items.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Regular (M)</h4>
                    Regular containers are 1 to 20 liters. They’re about the size of a shoebox. Many of these caches are ammo cans.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Large (L)</h4>
                    Large containers are more than 20 liters. They're larger than a shoebox. Buckets, bins, or even railroad freight cars can be large containers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Other (--)</h4>
                    Some containers just don't fit into size categories, like a magnetic sheet with a logbook attached. See the cache description for more information.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Finding and Hiding a cache</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Search for caches online</h4>
                    <p>Whether you are at your computer or out for the hunt, find a cache with your device and head out.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Find caches in the field</h4>
                    <p>Once you actually do find the cache sign the log book and put it back exactly like you found it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Log your find online</h4>
                    <p>On your device, or once you get home. Log your visit whether you found it or not. Letting the owner know if there is a problem or anything is very helpful. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Hiding a cache</h2>
            <p>Be sure to follow the <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/guidelines">guidelines</a>. Here is a short summary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Obay local laws</h4>
                    <p>Understand the law in the place you are thinking of hiding the cache. It may be prohibited.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Get Permission</h4>
                    <p>Get permission from the land owner to hide anywhere on their land. Public land is ok as long as you use wise judgement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Choose location wisely</h4>
                    <p>There are many people that do not geocache and my find it and thing it is garbage. Hiding the cache so that it will not likely be stumbled upon by other. Besides the best caches are those that are tricky to find.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Choose a proper container</h4>
                    <p>Think about where you are puting the cache. Water will be issue 99% of the time. Make sure it has a good seal. Lock and lock containers are good but after time they wear out and break down.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Submit your cache</h4>
                    <p>After getting all the details and a discription of the cache, and a hint if you wish, go on your account and submit it. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Maintain your cache</h4>
                    <p>Now that the cache is hidden and others can find it, it is your responsibility to keep it up. Keep and eye on the caches page and others will let you know in the log if it needs maintainance.</p>
