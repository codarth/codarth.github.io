                        <h1>The Me Section</h1>
                        <p>Greetings! I am Cody Crawford. I am a Game Developer with experience since August 2021. Prior to Game Development, I worked in other Software Development. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in New Media from the University of Lethbridge.</p>
                        <p>I have a deep passion and love for games. While working in the game industry, my desire to do more in game development has grown exponentially. One of my desires is to work as an AI developer. My desire and skills for AI has increased as I was able to create Animals in the game <a href="https://www.new.playdeadmatter.com/">Dead Matter</a> I was honored to be a part of. </p>
                        <p>Though I have my desires and passions, I am more then happy to work in other areas of development. For example, I enjoyed taking the lead while developing software for <a href="https://www.sentrybox.com/store.html">The Sentry Box's</a> till/inventory system.</p>
                        <p>Something that I am known for is my work ethic. Working at <a href="https://www.sentrybox.com/store.html">The Sentry Box's</a> reenforced the need to figure things out with no direct help from a team of developers. My skills in problem solving and working independent was greatly exercised. Working at QI was a team environment which allowed me to learn to work with others in a professional setting.</p>
                        <p>Outside working for others, I have my own personal projects. The one I am focusing on now is a simple local multiplayer farming game where you compete to fulfill orders for customers. I am having to work around the limitations I am finding while working with Unreal Engine. One of these limitations is their split screen system.</p>
                        <p>For more projects I have been involved in, take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/codarth">GitHub</a>.</p>

                            <h3>QI Software and DeadMatter</h3>
                            <p>Joining <b>QI</b> got me into the gaming industry. I began working with the small team at the time on their game <a href="https://www.new.playdeadmatter.com/">Dead Matter</a>. This game was developed in Unreal Engine. My role was a game developer. Throughout my time at QI I was able to touch on different areas. Some of these were AI programming, Sound implementation, and other game mechanics.</p>
                            <p>Working with AI, influenced by my manager, I stepped away from Blackboards and Behavior Trees. I wrote the AI for the animals with Blueprints and C++.</p>
                            <p>Sound implementation changed a few times while I was working on it. Wwise was used for a time, then sound was switched to Unreals Sound Cues, SoundScape, and Metasounds.</p>
                            <p>One game mechanic I took on was foliage harvesting. I created a tree chopping system and bush harvesting to add engagement to the player experience. Trees could be chopped down for logs and the logs could be chopped into planks. Bushes were a source of food. This also allowed other systems to use the material gathered from the harvesting, base building with the wood from trees for example.</p>
                            <p>Using source control, I was able to gain a better understanding of Git. Also, learned a good deal of Perforce.</p>
                            <h3>The Sentry Box</h3>
                            <p>Working at <a href="https://www.sentrybox.com/store.html">The Sentry Box's</a>, I was tasked to take over the development of their till/inventory system upgrade. I was thrown in to the project with no real training or understanding of the current state, not to mention the lack of knowledge of the pipeline they were using. I am extremely grateful for this in the end.</p>
                            <p>I was able to gain better skills in troubleshooting, research, and reading others code. There were plenty of times I had to find answers only to come up with something that was somewhat close. From these, I took the concept and applied it to what I really needed.</p>
                            <p>Some tools and languages I used were C#, .NET, WPF/Win Forms, ReactiveUI/Dynamic Data, MySQL. In the end, The Sentry Box was up and running with the new software. Maintenance, updates, and additions were ongoing.</p>

                            <p>The assignment was to make a 30 second advertisement about a product. My idea was to make a ad about a game I like to play. I was the director and camera man.</p>

                            <p>This project was to make a documentary about a event from one of our families. This was a story from my family recorded in my great grandfathers journal. It is called the Missing Milk.</p>

                            <p>Our final project of the course. Our topic was "the Landslide of Future technology." I came up with the idea after watching a documentary in class. The concept is that the tattoos were to allow the person to use it a authentication and the replacement of identification, or having to carry around bank cards. The landslide is that there is always some way to manipulate the outcome of the idea. Hence the hacker causing them to buy the skittles and to start dancing.</p>
