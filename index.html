										<h4>Farmers Rush (WIP Name)</h4>
										<p>
											In this project I am creating a competitive farming game for 1-4 players in local split screen. The
											main menu will be a interactive menu where players join as a character that can move around, an idea I
											got from a couple other games.
										</p>
										<p>
											One of the main issues I ran into so far is the split screen. The way my game is setup if there are
											less then 4 players then the split screen would still have four sections. Doing some research and
											troubleshooting I came across
